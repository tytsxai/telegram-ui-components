## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue for security-sensitive reports.

If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, contact the maintainer via the GitHub profile associated with this repository and include:
- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce / proof-of-concept (if available)
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or stack traces

## Supported versions

Security updates are provided for the latest version on the default branch (`main`).
